TAs
-------------------------

I really enjoy sharing knowledge, specially with people who are not yet
aware of how computers can make their lives a lot easier. That's why I've been
a TA since 2015.

* **Introduction to Programming** (2016-2): This course pretends to
  show the basics of Programming in Python.
